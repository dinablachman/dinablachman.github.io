hi, iâ€™m **dina**! i'm a student + developer at Columbia studying **cs & philosophy**.

i care deeply about how generative AI models are developed, regulated, and integrated into our daily lives without stripping away human creativity and agency.

this summer, under the guidance of [Prof. Muresan](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/), i helped develop a human-AI collaboration framework to detect prosecutorial misconduct with Columbia Law School and Columbia Journalism Investigations.

before that, i was an API intern at [Carson](https://www.carson.live/), where i built and shipped code used across hundreds of multifamily properties to automate resident-facing workflows.
