hi, iâ€™m **dina**! i'm a student at Columbia studying **CS & Philosophy**.

i am most interested in learning how generative AI models can be built and trained to make our lives more fulfilling while putting human creativity and agency at the forefront.

this summer, under the guidance of [Prof. Muresan](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smara/), i helped develop a human-AI collaboration framework to detect prosecutorial misconduct with Columbia Law School and Columbia Journalism Investigations. our poster can be found [here](/assets/improperconduct.pdf).

before that, i was an API intern at [Carson](https://www.carson.live/).
